# TO SOLVE

- Cannot look for a pokemon again after catching it, even if it is removed from My Pokes
- After catching a Pokemon, when looking for a new one there's a flash of the one that just has been catched
- Have not been able to make a loading state for when I'm looking for a new pokemon
- When "?" is on the card on "Catch new" section, there's no black border on it
